## 🎯 About Our Laboratory

Welcome to the **Human-Centered AI Sarajevo Laboratory**! We are a cutting-edge research group at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering Sarajevo](https://etf.unsa.ba/en/o-nama), [University of Sarajevo](https://www.unsa.ba/en), dedicated to developing artificial intelligence systems that can understand, interact, and collaborate with humans in trustworthy and ethical ways.

Our mission is to create AI solutions that enhance human capabilities, well-being, and social good while respecting human values, preferences, and autonomy. We bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and human-centered design principles.

## 🔬 Research Areas

Our laboratory focuses on six core research areas:

### 🤖 Explainable AI
Developing transparent and interpretable AI systems that humans can understand and trust. We work on making complex AI decisions comprehensible to users across various domains.

### 🦾 Robot Learning
Advancing robotic systems through machine learning and automated planning techniques. Our research enables robots to learn from experience and adapt to dynamic environments.

### 🧠 Human-Agent Interaction
Creating intuitive and effective collaboration between humans and AI agents. We design interaction paradigms that feel natural and enhance human-AI teamwork.

### ⚡ Reinforcement Learning
Teaching AI systems to make optimal decisions through interaction with environments. Our work spans from theoretical foundations to practical applications.

### 🛡️ Ethical AI
Ensuring AI systems align with human values, fairness, and societal well-being. We address bias, fairness, and ethical implications of AI deployment.

### 🔒 AI Security
Protecting AI systems from adversarial attacks and ensuring robust performance. We develop methods to make AI systems resilient and trustworthy.
